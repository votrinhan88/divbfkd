    """Time a given task with timeit.
    
    Args:
        `task`: Task for timing.
        `setup`: Setup code which does not count towards timing. Defaults to   \
            `'pass'`.
        `repeat`: Number of runs timing is performed. Defaults to `1`.
        `number`: Number of times `task` is executed in each run. Defaults to  \
            `None`, skip to automatically increase from the sequence 1, 2, 5,  \
            10, 20, 50, â€¦ until the time taken is at least 0.2 second.
    
    Returns:
        A list of (number, time taken) if `number` is None.
        Or a list of time taken if `number` is an int.

    To pass in `task` with arguments, use `task = lambda:my_task(my_arg=...)`.
